enyoBasicTutorial
=================

This is a preliminary research on enyoJS version 2.2. Not quite fully understand the deploy and minification of libraries yet, 
but this sample was build using the lib folder provided by bootplates and the css given.

Got the correct minimum folder structure right too, you must have :-

[enyo folder]
[lib folder]
app.js, index.html <-- linked up to enyo and lib

Tutorials Cover - my own observation on :-

1. How layout system works
2. How events are fired and handled
3. How components and kinds are loaded
4. How custom styled are programmed
5. How filter search is conducted

Note Important: In Enyo Almost anything MUST PROVIDE exact height to compute accurate listview and toolbar, any div along the row.
